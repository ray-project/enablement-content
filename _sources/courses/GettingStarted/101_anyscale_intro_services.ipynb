    "# 101 Introduction to Anyscale Services\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Productionize your AI/ML online inference workload with scalable, fault-tolerant infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Anyscale Services** utilizes **Ray Serve** to provide a managed experince for deploying performant, scalable and reliable services. Each **Anyscale Service** runs on its own dedicated Ray cluster. Anyscale will also manage the infrastructure around a service, enabling autoscaling, high availability, observability, and zero-downtime upgrades.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of using Anyscale Services\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Autoscaling:** Scale automatically based on demand\n",
    "- **High Availiability / Resilient:** Tolerate node or process failures gracefully\n",
    "- **Mature Deployment Strategies:** Roll out updates incrementally with traffic shifting\n",
    "- **Enterprise Ready:** Integrate easily with Grafana dashboards and alerting systems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Anyscale Service Lifecycle\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User deploys Ray Serve application (e.g., `app/main.py`) with Anyscale Service**\n",
    "2. **Anyscale spins up a Ray cluster**\n",
    "3. **Anyscale creates a load balancer (one per Anyscale Cloud)**\n",
    "4. **User Configures Handling failures (e.g., head node HA)**\n",
    "5. **Rolling out new versions**\n",
    "    - New cluster is launched\n",
    "    - Traffic is gradually shifted after health checks\n",
    "    - Old cluster is safely terminated\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 1. Spin up a **Anyscale Workspace,** we will use this as the environment to develop and publish the Anyscale Service. Give this workspace a name, check the **Auto-Select Worker Nodes** and leave everything else as default.\n",

    "#### 3. Inspect the code for the Service Endpoint **(./examples/02_service_hello_world/main.py)**\n",
    "\n",
    "For this implementation, we will define a FastAPI application and deploy it using Ray Serve. Ray Serve wraps the FastAPI app (`FastAPIDeployment`) to manage this API (e.g. Autoscaling, Load Balancing).\n",

    "**Make the following modification to the last line of code,** this prepares the app for deployment instead of running it immediately."
