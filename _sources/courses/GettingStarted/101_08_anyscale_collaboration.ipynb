    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyscale makes it simple for engineers to collaborate on AI/ML applications by providing functionalities to share, organize, and duplicate work. Anyscale allows for granular access controls at the following levels:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Organization, a group of Anyscale users\n",
    "- [Cloud](https://docs.anyscale.com/administration/cloud-deployment/overview), a deployment of Anyscale that specifies where clusters launch (e.g. AWS / GCP / On Premises)\n",
    "- [Project](https://docs.anyscale.com/administration/organization/projects), a group of workspaces, jobs, or services\n",
    "\n",
    "### Anyscale Projects\n",
    "\n",
    "[Anyscale Projects](https://docs.anyscale.com/administration/organization/projects/) serve as a location for you to group Anyscale resources within a Anyscale Cloud. Unless specified, all of your work is captured in a “Default” project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resources in the default project are accessible to every user who has access to that Anyscale Cloud. Beyond organization, Projects can be used to restrict access to only users that have been given permission to access them."
