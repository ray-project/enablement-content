    "The Anyscale platform provides several tools to monitor and troubleshoot your applications. In this section we’ll cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Anyscale Log Viewer Tab:** provides persistent access for developers to query, view and download log files generated from your Ray apps, even after cluster termination.\n",
    "- **Anyscale Metrics Tab:** Anyscale provides built-in metrics for monitoring your Ray clusters and the workloads you run on them\n",
    "- **Ray Dashboard Tab:** Ray provides a web-based dashboard for monitoring and debugging Ray applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open your existing **Anyscale Workspace** (or spin up a new one). Modify the node group configuration to include lightweight CPU nodes (e.g. m5 on Amazon EC2). Enable autoscaling to scale out from 0 to 10.\n",
