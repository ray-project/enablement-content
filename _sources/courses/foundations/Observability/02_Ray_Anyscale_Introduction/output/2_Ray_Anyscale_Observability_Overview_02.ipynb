    "In the context of Ray, observability is the ability for users to monitor and reason about the behavior of Ray applications and clusters through external signals such as logs, metrics, and events.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Logs**: Log messages from Ray applications running on both driver and worker processes (potentially across multiple machines).\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Metrics**: Physical statistics (e.g., CPU, memory, GPU, disk, and network usage of each node), internal statistics (e.g., number of actors in the cluster, number of worker failures), and custom application metrics defined by users.\n",

    "- **Events**: Chronologically ordered events associated with specific components (e.g., autoscaler or job events) that provide insights into system behavior and state changes.\n",
