    "[Ray Serve](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/index.html) is a highly scalable and flexible model serving library for building online inference APIs that allows you to:\n",
    "- Wrap models and business logic as separate [serve deployments](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/key-concepts.html#deployment) and [connect](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/model_composition.html) them together (pipeline, ensemble, etc.)\n",
    "- Avoid one large service that's network and compute bounded and an inefficient use of resources.\n",
    "- Utilize fractional heterogeneous [resources](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/resource-allocation.html), which **isn't possible** with SageMaker, Vertex, KServe, etc., and horizontally scale with`num_replicas`.\n",
    "- [autoscale](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/autoscaling-guide.html) up and down based on traffic.\n",
    "- Integrate with [FastAPI and HTTP](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/http-guide.html).\n",
    "- Set up a [gRPC service](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/advanced-guides/grpc-guide.html#set-up-a-grpc-service) to build distributed systems and microservices.\n",
    "- Enable [dynamic batching](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/advanced-guides/dyn-req-batch.html) based on batch size, time, etc.\n",
    "- Access a suite of [utilities for serving LLMs](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/llm/serving-llms.html) that are inference-engine agnostic and have batteries-included support for LLM-specific features such as multi-LoRA support\n",

    "\ud83d\udd25 [RayTurbo Serve](https://docs.anyscale.com/rayturbo/rayturbo-serve) on Anyscale has more functionality on top of Ray Serve:\n",
    "- **fast autoscaling and model loading** to get services up and running even faster with [5x improvements](https://www.anyscale.com/blog/autoscale-large-ai-models-faster) even for LLMs.\n",
    "- 54% **higher QPS** and up-to 3x **streaming tokens per second** for high traffic serving use-cases with no proxy bottlenecks.\n",
    "- **replica compaction** into fewer nodes where possible to reduce resource fragmentation and improve hardware utilization.\n",
    "- **zero-downtime** [incremental rollouts](https://docs.anyscale.com/platform/services/update-a-service/#resource-constrained-updates) so your service is never interrupted.\n",
    "- [**different environments**](https://docs.anyscale.com/platform/services/multi-app/#multiple-applications-in-different-containers) for each service in a multi-serve application.\n",
    "- **multi availability-zone** aware scheduling of Ray Serve replicas to provide higher redundancy to availability zone failures."
