    "## How to Choose an LLM?\n",
    "\n",
    "With so many models available, choosing the right one for your use case is crucial. Here's a practical framework for model selection based on the [Anyscale documentation](https://docs.anyscale.com/llm/serving/intro#selecting-model).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Selection Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Model Quality Benchmarks**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use established benchmarks to evaluate model capabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chatbot Arena**: For conversational capabilities and user preference\n",
    "- **MMLU-Pro**: For domain-specific performance across academic subjects\n",
    "- **Code Benchmarks**: For programming and code generation tasks\n",
    "- **Reasoning Tests**: For logical reasoning and problem-solving\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Task and Domain Alignment**\n",
    "\n",
    "Match your model to your specific use case:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Model Type | Best For | Example Use Cases |\n",
    "|------------|----------|-------------------|\n",
    "| **Base Models** | Next-token prediction, open-ended continuation | Sentence completion, code autocomplete |\n",
    "| **Instruction-tuned** | Following explicit directions | Chatbots, coding assistants, Q&A |\n",
    "| **Reasoning-optimized** | Complex problem-solving | Mathematical reasoning, scientific analysis |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Context Window Requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "Match context length to your use case:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Context Length | Use Cases | Memory Impact |\n",
    "|----------------|-----------|---------------|\n",
    "| **4K-8K tokens** | Q&A, simple chat | Low memory requirements |\n",
    "| **32K-128K tokens** | Document analysis, summarization | Moderate memory usage |\n",
    "| **128K+ tokens** | Multi-step agents, complex reasoning | High memory requirements |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Hardware and Cost Considerations**\n",
    "\n",
    "Balance performance with resource constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Small Models (7B-13B)**: 1-2 GPUs, fast deployment, lower cost\n",
    "- **Medium Models (70B-80B)**: 4-8 GPUs, balanced performance/cost\n",
    "- **Large Models (400B+)**: Multiple nodes, maximum capability, higher cost\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Selection Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define Requirements**: Latency, accuracy, context length, budget\n",
    "2. **Benchmark Models**: Test on your specific tasks and data\n",
    "3. **Consider Trade-offs**: Speed vs. accuracy, cost vs. capability\n",
    "4. **Start Simple**: Begin with smaller models, scale up as needed\n",
    "5. **Iterate and Optimize**: Monitor performance and adjust accordingly\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Recommendations by Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Production Chatbots:**\n",
    "- Llama 3.1 8B/70B (balanced performance)\n",
    "- Mistral 7B (fast inference)\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Code Generation:**\n",
    "- Code Llama 7B/13B (specialized for code)\n",
    "- DeepSeek-Coder (reasoning + code)\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Complex Reasoning:**\n",
    "- Qwen 3 32B (hybrid thinking)\n",
    "- DeepSeek-R1 (dedicated reasoning)\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Document Processing:**\n",
    "- Llama 3.1 70B (large context)\n",
    "- Claude 3.5 Sonnet (excellent long context)\n"
