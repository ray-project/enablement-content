    "## Overview: Advanced Features Preview\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've mastered the basics of LLM deployment with Ray Serve LLM, let's explore some advanced features that make production LLM serving more powerful and flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We'll Cover\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, we'll focus on **3 practical examples** that demonstrate advanced capabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **LoRA Adapters**: Deploy multiple fine-tuned adapters on a single base model\n",
    "2. **Structured Output**: Generate consistent JSON and other structured formats\n",
    "3. **Tool Calling**: Enable models to call external functions and APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why These Features Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "**LoRA Adapters** allow you to:\n",
    "- Serve multiple specialized models from one base model\n",
    "- Reduce memory usage and deployment complexity\n",
    "- Switch between different fine-tuned behaviors at runtime\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structured Output** enables:\n",
    "- Consistent, parseable responses for applications\n",
    "- Integration with downstream systems\n",
    "- Better reliability for production use cases\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tool Calling** provides:\n",
    "- Integration with external APIs and databases\n",
    "- Enhanced model capabilities through function execution\n",
    "- Building more sophisticated AI applications\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll take a **hands-on approach** - each example will show you:\n",
    "- Why the feature is useful\n",
    "- How to configure it\n",
    "- Working code you can run\n",
    "- Links to comprehensive guides for deeper learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive in!\n"
