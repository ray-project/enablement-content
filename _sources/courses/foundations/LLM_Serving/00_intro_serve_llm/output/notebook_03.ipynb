After several iterations (right), the completed sequences each have different sizes because each emits their end-of-sequence-token (red) at different iterations. Even though sequence 3 finished after two iterations, static batching means that the GPU will be underutilized until the last sequence in the batch finishes generation (in this example, sequence 2 after six iterations).|"
