    "|Challenge|Detail|Solution|\n",
    "|---|---|---|\n",
    "|**Need to speed up or scale up training**| Training jobs might take a long time to complete, or require a lot of compute | Ray Train provides a **distributed training** framework that allows engineers to scale training jobs to multiple GPUs |\n",
    "|**Minimize overhead of setting up clusters**| Engineers need to manage the underlying infrastructure | Ray Train **provisions the underlying infrastructure** via Ray's cluster autoscaler. |\n",
    "|**Achieve observability**| Engineers need to connect to different nodes and GPUs to find the root cause of failures, fetch logs, traces, etc | Ray Train **provides observability** via Ray's dashboard, metrics, and traces that allow engineers to monitor the training job |\n",
    "|**Ensure reliable training**| Training jobs can fail due to hardware failures, network issues, or other unexpected events | Ray Train **ensures fault tolerance** via checkpointing, automatic retries, and the ability to resume training from the last checkpoint |\n",
    "|**Avoid significant code rewrite**| Engineers might need to fully rewrite their training loop to support distributed training | Ray Train has **built-in integrations** with the PyTorch ecosystem (Torch, Lightning, Huggingface), Tree-based methods (XGB, LGBM), and more to minimize the amount of code changes needed |\n"
