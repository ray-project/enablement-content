    "# Introduction to Ray: Developer\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Welcome and Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This course provides a comprehensive introduction to Ray with hands-on examples and practical use cases, designed to help developers quickly master distributed computing and scale their Python applications from development to production.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìã Notebook Compute Requirements Legend\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this course, you'll see these symbols in each notebook to indicate the recommended compute environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Symbol | Meaning | Description |\n",
    "|--------|---------|-------------|\n",
    "| üíª | **Launch Locally** | Whether the notebook can run efficiently on your laptop/local machine |\n",
    "| üöÄ | **Launch on Cloud** | Benefits from GPU acceleration, cloud recommended |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: For üöÄ notebooks, we recommend using [Anyscale](http://console.anyscale.com/register) with a Ray cluster that has GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Ray?\n",
    "\n",
    "Today's ML workloads are increasingly compute-intensive. As convenient as they are, single-node development environments such as your laptop cannot scale to meet these demands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ray is a unified way to scale Python and AI applications from a laptop to a cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Ray, you can seamlessly scale the same code from a laptop to a cluster. Ray is designed to be general-purpose, meaning that it can performantly run any kind of workload. If your application is written in Python, you can scale it with Ray, no other infrastructure required.\n",
