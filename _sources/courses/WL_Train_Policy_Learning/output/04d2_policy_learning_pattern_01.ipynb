    "\n",
    "Here\u2019s how the transition works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Gym rollouts \u2192 Ray Dataset**  \n",
    "   Generate simulation rollouts from `Pendulum-v1` and stream them directly into a **Ray Dataset**, enabling distributed preprocessing (For example, normalization) and automatic partitioning across workers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Local Training \u2192 Cluster-scale Distributed Training**  \n",
    "   Wrap a minimal `LightningModule` in a Ray Train `train_loop`, then launch training with **TorchTrainer** across 8 A10G GPUs. Ray handles data sharding, worker setup, and device placement without boilerplate.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Manual State Saving \u2192 Lightning-Integrated Checkpointing & Auto-Resume**  \n",
    "   Checkpointing and metric tracking are handled automatically by **PyTorch Lightning** and **Ray Train V2**.  \n",
    "   The `RayTrainReportCallback()` forwards Lightning\u2019s `checkpoint.ckpt` files and logged metrics to Ray,  \n",
    "   enabling **structured, fault-tolerant training** with seamless resume support. No manual save or report logic required.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Ad-hoc Coordination \u2192 Declarative Orchestration**  \n",
    "   Replace manual logging, retry logic, and resource management with **Ray-native configs** (`ScalingConfig`, `CheckpointConfig`, `FailureConfig`), letting Ray + Anyscale own the orchestration.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Notebook-only Inference \u2192 Cluster-aware Evaluation**  \n",
    "   After training, perform **reverse diffusion sampling** in-notebook using the latest checkpoint\u2014but this can easily scale using **Ray Data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This flow upgrades a local notebook into a **multi-node, resilient training + inference pipeline**, using Ray\u2019s native abstractions and running seamlessly inside an Anyscale Workspace, without sacrificing dev agility.\n"
