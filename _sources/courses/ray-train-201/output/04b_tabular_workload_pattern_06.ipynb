    "## \ud83c\udf89 Wrapping Up & Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Awesome work making it to the end. You\u2019ve built a fast and fault-tolerant XGBoost training loop that runs on real data, scales across CPUs, recovers from worker failures, and supports batch inference, all inside a single notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should now feel confident:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using **Ray Data** to ingest, shuffle, and shard large tabular datasets across a cluster  \n",
    "* Defining custom `train_func`s that run on **Ray Train** workers and resume seamlessly from checkpoints  \n",
    "* Tracking per-round metrics and saving checkpoints with **RayTrainReportCallback**  \n",
    "* Leveraging **Ray\u2019s distributed execution model** to evaluate and monitor models without manual orchestration  \n",
    "* Launching remote CPU-powered inference tasks using **Ray remote functions** for scalable batch scoring\n",

    "### \ud83d\ude80 Where can you take this next?\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are a few directions you might explore to adapt or extend the pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Early Stopping & Best Iteration Tracking**  \n",
    "   * Add `early_stopping_rounds=10` to `xgb.train` and log the best round.  \n",
    "   * Track performance delta across resumed runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hyperparameter Sweeps**  \n",
    "   * Wrap the trainer with **Ray Tune** and search over `eta`, `max_depth`, or `subsample`.  \n",
    "   * Use Tune\u2019s built-in checkpoint pruning and log callbacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feature Engineering at Scale**  \n",
    "   * Create new features using `Ray Dataset.map_batches`, such as terrain interactions or log-scaled distances.  \n",
    "   * Materialize multiple Parquet shards and benchmark load time.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Interpretability**  \n",
    "   * Use XGBoost\u2019s built-in `Booster.get_score` for feature attributions.  \n",
    "   * Rank features by importance and validate with domain knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Serving the Model**  \n",
    "   * Package the Booster as a Ray task or **Ray Serve** endpoint.  \n",
    "   * Deploy an API that takes a feature vector and returns the predicted cover type.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Real-Time Logging**  \n",
    "   * Integrate with MLflow or Weights & Biases to store logs, plots, and checkpoints.  \n",
    "   * Use tags and metadata to track experiments over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Alternative Objectives**  \n",
    "   * Try a binary objective (For example, presence vs. absence of a species) or regression target (For example, canopy height).  \n",
    "   * Fine-tune loss functions for specific ecological tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **End-to-End MLOps**  \n",
    "   * Schedule retraining with Ray Jobs or Anyscale Jobs.  \n",
    "   * Upload new data snapshots and trigger daily training runs with automatic checkpoint cleanup.\n"
