    "\n",
    "Here\u2019s how you make that transition:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Local Joint Photographic Experts Groups (JPEG) \u2192 Distributed Ray Dataset**  \n",
    "   Preprocess and store Food-101 images as Parquet, then use **Ray Data** to load and decode the dataset in parallel across the cluster. Each worker gets its own shard, streamed efficiently for GPU training.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Single-GPU PyTorch \u2192 Multi-node Distributed Training**  \n",
    "   Wrap your Lightning model in a Ray Train `train_loop`, then launch distributed training using **TorchTrainer** with 8 GPU workers\u2014each operating on its own data partition with no manual coordination.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Manual Checkpoints \u2192 Lightning-Integrated Fault Tolerance**  \n",
    "   Checkpointing and recovery are now handled automatically by **PyTorch Lightning** in combination with **Ray Train V2**.  \n",
    "   The `RayTrainReportCallback()` forwards each Lightning `checkpoint.ckpt` to Ray, enabling **structured, automatic resume and fault-tolerant training** with no manual save or report logic required.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Manual Data Management \u2192 Declarative Scaling with Ray**  \n",
    "   Instead of slicing data or managing worker processes yourself, declare your intent with `ScalingConfig`, `CheckpointConfig`, and `FailureConfig`, and let **Ray + Anyscale handle the orchestration**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern transforms a simple single-node PyTorch loop into a **scalable, fault-tolerant, multi-node training pipeline** with just a few lines of Ray-specific code, and it runs seamlessly on any cluster provisioned with Anyscale.\n"
