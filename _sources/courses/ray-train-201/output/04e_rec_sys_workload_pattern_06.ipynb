    "Awesome work making it to the end. In this tutorial, you used **Ray Train and Ray Data on Anyscale** to scale a full matrix factorization recommendation system, end-to-end, from a raw CSV to multi-GPU distributed training and personalized top-N item recommendations.\n",

    "* Using **Ray Data** to preprocess, encode, and shard large tabular datasets  \n",

    "### \ud83d\ude80 Where can you take this next?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few directions you can explore to extend or adapt this workload:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ranking Metrics & Evaluation**  \n",
    "   * Add metrics like **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**, **Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)**, or **Hit@K** to evaluate recommendation quality.  \n",
    "   * Filter out already-rated items during inference to measure novelty.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Two-Tower and Deep Models**  \n",
    "   * Replace dot product with a **two-tower neural model** or a **deep MLP**.  \n",
    "   * Add side features (For example, timestamp, genre) into each tower for better personalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recommendation Personalization**  \n",
    "   * Store and cache user embeddings after training.  \n",
    "   * Run lightweight inference tasks to generate recommendations in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Content-Based or Hybrid Models**  \n",
    "   * Join movie metadata (genres, tags) and build a hybrid collaborative\u2013content model.  \n",
    "   * Embed titles or genres using pre-trained language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Hyperparameter Optimization**  \n",
    "   * Use **Ray Tune** to sweep embedding sizes, learning rates, or regularization.  \n",
    "   * Track performance over epochs and checkpoint the best models automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Data Scaling**  \n",
    "   * Switch from MovieLens 100K to 1M or 10M as Ray Data handles it seamlessly.  \n",
    "   * Save and load from cloud object storage (S3, GCS) for real-world deployments.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Production Inference**  \n",
    "   * Wrap the recommendation system into a **Ray Serve** endpoint for serving top-N results.  \n",
    "   * Build a simple demo that recommends movies to live users.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **End-to-End MLOps**  \n",
    "   * Register the best model with MLflow or Weights & Biases.  \n",
    "   * Package the training job as a Ray Job and schedule it with Anyscale.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Multi-tenant recommendation systems**  \n",
    "   * Extend this to support **multiple audiences** or contexts (For example, multi-country, A/B groups).  \n",
    "   * Train and serve context-aware models in parallel using Ray.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern gives you a solid foundation for scaling recommendation workloads across real datasets and real infrastructure\u2014without rewriting your model or managing your cluster. Let Ray + Anyscale do the heavy lifting."
