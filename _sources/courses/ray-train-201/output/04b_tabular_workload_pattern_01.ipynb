    "In this tutorial you take the classic **Cover type forest-cover dataset** (580 k rows, 54 tabular features) and scale an **XGBoost** model across an Anyscale cluster using **Ray Train V2**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What you\u2019ll learn & take away\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ingest tabular data at scale using **Ray Data** and persist it to Parquet for reproducibility  \n",
    "- Launch a fault-tolerant, checkpoint enabled **XGBoost training loop** on multiple CPUs using **Ray Train**  \n",
    "- Resume training from checkpoints across job restarts and hardware failures  \n",
    "- Evaluate model accuracy, visualize feature importance, and scale batch inference using **Ray remote tasks**  \n",
    "- Understand how to port classic gradient boosting workflows into a **fully distributed, multi-node training setup on Anyscale**"

    "\n",
    "**XGBoost** (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is a fast, scalable machine learning algorithm based on **gradient-boosted decision trees**. It builds a sequence of shallow decision trees, where each new tree tries to correct the errors of the previous ensemble by minimizing a differentiable loss (like log-loss).\n",

    "### \ud83e\udded How you\u2019ll migrate this tabular workload to a distributed setup using Ray on Anyscale\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial walks through the end-to-end process of **migrating a local XGBoost training pipeline to a distributed Ray cluster running on Anyscale**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here\u2019s how you make that transition:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Local \u2192 Remote Data**  \n",
    "   Store the raw data as Parquet in a shared cloud directory and load it using **Ray Data**, which streams and shards the dataset across workers automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Single-process \u2192 Multi-worker Training**  \n",
    "   Define a custom `train_func`, then let **Ray Train** spin up 16 distributed training workers (1 per CPU) and run `xgb.train` in parallel, each with its own data shard.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Manual Checkpointing \u2192 Automated Fault Tolerance**  \n",
    "   With `RayTrainReportCallback` and `CheckpointConfig`, Ray saves checkpoints every 10 boosting rounds and can resume mid-training if any worker crashes or a job is re-launched.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Manual Loops \u2192 Cluster-scale Abstractions**  \n",
    "   Skip the boilerplate of manually slicing datasets, coordinating workers, or building launch scripts. Instead, declare intent (with `ScalingConfig`, `RunConfig`, and `FailureConfig`) and let **Ray + Anyscale** manage the execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Offline Inference \u2192 Remote Tasks**  \n",
    "   Batch inference can launch as **Ray remote tasks** on CPU workers, which is useful for validation, drift detection, or live scoring inside a service.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern turns a traditional single-node workflow into a scalable, resilient training pipeline with minimal code changes, and it works seamlessly on any cluster you provision through Anyscale."
