    "This notebook demonstrates how to perform distributed training of a BERT model for sequence classification using Ray Train, PyTorch, and Hugging Face libraries. The goal is to classify Yelp reviews into categories by leveraging the power of distributed computing, which allows you to train large models efficiently across multiple CPUs or GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook starts by importing all the necessary libraries, including PyTorch for deep learning, Hugging Face Transformers for model and tokenizer utilities, and Ray Train for distributed training. It then sets up the evaluation metric (accuracy) and defines a function to compute this metric during model evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key part of the notebook is the training function, which is executed by each worker in the distributed setup. This function handles loading the Yelp review dataset, tokenizing the text data, preparing data loaders for batching, and setting up the BERT model for training. The function is designed to automatically use the best available hardware, whether that's a CPU, GPU, or Apple Silicon's MPS.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main training function, `train_bert`, configures the distributed environment using Ray, sets up the training parameters, and launches the training process across multiple workers. This approach allows you to scale up your training easily, making it suitable for both local machines and cloud platforms. After training, Ray is properly shut down to free up resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this notebook provides a practical introduction to distributed deep learning with modern Python tools, making it easier for machine learning engineers to train large models on big datasets efficiently."

It covers data loading, tokenization, model setup, and distributed training configuration, allowing you to efficiently train large models across multiple CPUs or GPUs. The notebook is designed to be accessible for machine learning engineers who want to learn scalable deep learning workflows using modern Python tools."
