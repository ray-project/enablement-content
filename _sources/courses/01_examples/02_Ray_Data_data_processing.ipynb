    "Data preprocessing is a crucial step in any machine learning workflow, and Ray Data provides a scalable and flexible way to handle this process on large datasets. With Ray Data, you can efficiently load, transform, filter, and join datasets using a distributed framework that leverages the power of multiple CPUs or nodes. This makes it possible to preprocess data that would be too large to fit into memory on a single machine, enabling seamless scaling from your laptop to a cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ray Data supports a variety of preprocessing operations, such as filtering rows based on conditions, joining multiple datasets, and applying custom transformations like tokenization or label encoding. For example, you can load a large public dataset like IMDB reviews, filter for only positive reviews, join with metadata, and tokenize the text—all in a distributed and parallelized manner. This approach not only speeds up data preparation but also integrates smoothly with downstream machine learning tasks, making Ray Data a powerful tool for modern data pipelines."

In particular she wants to focus her attentions to making some sort of documentary on what the average Swede thought about certain political issues such as the Vietnam War and race issues in the United States. In between asking politicians and ordinary denizens of Stockholm about their opinions on politics, she has sex with her drama teacher, classmates, and married men.<br /><br />What kills me about I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is that 40 years ago, this was considered pornographic. Really, the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, even then it\\'s not shot like some cheaply made porno. While my countrymen mind find it shocking, in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in Swedish cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, arguably their answer to good old boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his films.<br /><br />I do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in America. I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a good film for anyone wanting to study the meat and potatoes (no pun intended) of Swedish cinema. But really, this film doesn\\'t have much of a plot.',\n",
       "  '\"I Am Curious: Yellow\" is a risible and pretentious steaming pile. It doesn\\'t matter what one\\'s political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn\\'t true. I\\'ve seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don\\'t exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we\\'re treated to the site of Vincent Gallo\\'s throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appears nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won\\'t see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women\\'s bodies.',\n",
       "  \"If only to avoid making this type of film in the future. This film is interesting as an experiment but tells no cogent story.<br /><br />One might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many IMPORTANT issues but it does so without any discernable motive. The viewer comes away with no new perspectives (unless one comes up with one while one's mind wanders, as it will invariably do during this pointless film).<br /><br />One might better spend one's time staring out a window at a tree growing.<br /><br />\"],\n",

      "{'id': 13100, 'text': \"The fourth of five westerns Anthony Mann did with James Stewart, this one involves a hard bitten cattleman named Jeff Webster who takes a cattle drive from Wyoming to Alaska, via Seattle. He hooks up in Seattle with his partners Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan) and Rube Morris (Jay C. Flippen) that he has sent ahead of time in order to make preparations for the boat trip, north.<br /><br />But first, he has to put up with insubordinate trail hands, cheating riverboat captains and the charms of coy, manipulative Ronda Castle (Ruth Roman) who believes Jeff could be a valuable ally in the future. That's why she hides him out on the boat while the captain's looking for him for the earlier (and justifiable) killing of a trail hand.<br /><br />Jeff also has the misfortune of running into sleazy Judge Gannon (John McIntire) who runs the town of Skagway, Alaska. Gannon locks Jeff up for disrupting his public hanging by running his cattle through town. He fines Jeff the ownership of his cattle and Jeff just has to eat crow for the time being. <br /><br />In the meantime, Jeff agrees to ride point for Ronda up to Dawson in order to deliver supplies. But this is just a ruse so Jeff, Ben and Rube can slip back into Skagway and steal his cattle back. Of course Judge Gannon finds out about this and is right behind but is delayed by Jeff with a rifle while Ben races the cattle over the Canadian border out of Gannon's reach.<br /><br />After avoiding an avalanche and another shootout with some other Skagway men, they finally reach Dawson where Jeff sells his cattle to the highest bidder, which just happens to be Ronda who then promptly sets up a new gambling house in Dawson. Jeff then takes his money and buys himself a claim and starts panning for gold. <br /><br />But then Judge Gannon comes up to Dawson to get in on the gold action up there, and tells Jeff that he was getting a little bored with Skagway and wants to try his luck up in the Klondike, himself. That involves bring some hired gunman with him and forcibly stealing some of the other miner's claims. Jeff and Ben now feel it's time to clear out while the goings are good, leaving Rube to fend for himself as a most ineffective sheriff against Gannon and his gang.<br /><br />They look for a back way out only to find themselves ambushed by Gannon's men because Ben made the mistake of opening his big mouth. Ben is killed and Jeff is severely wounded but that doesn't save Judge Gannon from his just due. The ending shootout at night on the muddy Dawson street pretty much takes care of that. First Jeff kills two of Gannon's best gunman (Jack Elam and Robert Wilkie). Then as Ronda comes out to warn Jeff that Gannon is trying to slip around behind him, Gannon shoots her in the back and she dies right there in Jeff's arms. Then Jeff kills Gannon as he's hiding under a wooden sidewalk. Revenge has spoken.<br /><br />This is another rip-roaring western that's right up there with THE NAKED SPUR and THE MAN FROM LARAMIE. Why the Universal DVD uses a pan-and-scan print instead of the widescreen print TCM uses, is beyond me. You'll wind up missing half the glorious Alberta cinematography by William Daniels.

Some of them are very original while others are best forgotten.<br /><br />He depicts postwar Germany as a nightmarish train journey. With so many cities lying in ruins, Leo Kessler a young American of German descent feels obliged to help in their restoration. It is not a simple task as he quickly finds out.<br /><br />His uncle finds him a job as a night conductor on the Zentropa Railway Line. His job is to attend to the needs of the passengers. When the shoes are polished a chalk mark is made on the soles. A terrible argument ensues when a passenger's shoes are not chalked despite the fact they have been polished. There are many allusions to the German fanaticism of adherence to such stupid details.<br /><br />The railway journey is like an allegory representing man's procession through life with all its trials and tribulations. In one sequence Leo dashes through the back carriages to discover them filled with half-starved bodies appearing to have just escaped from Auschwitz . These images, horrible as they are, are fleeting as in a dream, each with its own terrible impact yet unconnected.<br /><br />At a station called Urmitz Leo jumps from the train with a parceled bomb. In view of many by-standers he connects the bomb to the underside of a carriage. He returns to his cabin and makes a connection to a time clock. Later he jumps from the train (at high speed) and lies in the cool grass on a river bank. Looking at the stars above he decides that his job is to build and not destroy. Subsequently as he sees the train approaching a giant bridge he runs at breakneck speed to board the train and stop the clock. If you care to analyse the situation it is a completely impossible task. Quite ridiculous in fact. It could only happen in a dream.<br /><br />It's strange how one remembers little details such as a row of cups hanging on hooks and rattling away with the swaying of the train.<br /><br />Despite the fact that this film is widely acclaimed, I prefer Lars Von Trier's later films (Breaking the Waves and The Idiots). The bomb scene described above really put me off.

      "{'id': 12503, 'text': '*Contains spoilers due to me having to describe some film techniques, so read at your own risk!*<br /><br />I loved this film. The use of tinting in some of the scenes makes it seem like an old photograph come to life. I also enjoyed the projection of people on a back screen. For instance, in one scene, Leopold calls his wife and she is projected behind him rather than in a typical split screen. Her face is huge in the back and Leo\\'s is in the foreground.<br /><br />One of the best uses of this is when the young boys kill the Ravensteins on the train, a scene shot in an almost political poster style, with facial close ups. It reminded me of Battleship Potemkin, that intense constant style coupled with the spray of red to convey tons of horror without much gore. Same with the scene when Katharina finds her father dead in the bathtub...you can only see the red water on the side. It is one of the things I love about Von Trier, his understatement of horror, which ends up making it all the more creepy.<br /><br />The use of text in the film was unique, like when Leo\\'s character is pushed by the word, \"Werewolf.\" I have never seen anything like that in a film.<br /><br />The use of black comedy in this film was well done. Ernst-Hugo Järegård is great as Leo\\'s uncle. It brings up the snickers I got from his role in the Kingdom (Riget.) This humor makes the plotline of absurd anal retentiveness of train conductors against the terrible backdrop of WW2 and all the chaos, easier to take. It reminds me of Riget in the way the hospital administrator is trying to maintain a normalcy at the end of part one when everything is going crazy. It shows that some people are truly oblivious to the awful things happening around them. Yet some people, like Leo, are tuned in, but do nothing positive about it.<br /><br />The voice over, done expertly well by Max von Sydow, is amusing too. It draws you into the story and makes you jump into Leo\\'s head, which at times is a scary place to be.<br /><br />The movie brings up the point that one is a coward if they don\\'t choose a side. I see the same idea used in Dancer in the Dark, where Bjork\\'s character doesn\\'t speak up for herself and ends up being her own destruction. Actually, at one time, Von Trier seemed anti-woman to me, by making Breaking the Waves and Dancer, but now I know his male characters don\\'t fare well either! I found myself at the same place during the end of Dancer, when you seriously want the main character to rethink their actions, but of course, they never do!', 'label': 1, 'text_tokenized': ['Contains', 'spoilers', 'due', 'to', 'me', 'having', 'to', 'describe', 'some', 'film', 'techniques', 'so', 'read', 'at', 'your', 'own', 'riskbr', 'br', 'I', 'loved', 'this', 'film', 'The', 'use', 'of', 'tinting', 'in', 'some', 'of', 'the', 'scenes', 'makes', 'it', 'seem', 'like', 'an', 'old', 'photograph', 'come', 'to', 'life', 'I', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'the', 'projection', 'of', 'people', 'on', 'a', 'back', 'screen', 'For', 'instance', 'in', 'one', 'scene', 'Leopold', 'calls', 'his', 'wife', 'and', 'she', 'is', 'projected', 'behind', 'him', 'rather', 'than', 'in', 'a', 'typical', 'split', 'screen', 'Her', 'face', 'is', 'huge', 'in', 'the', 'back', 'and', 'Leos', 'is', 'in', 'the', 'foregroundbr', 'br', 'One', 'of', 'the', 'best', 'uses', 'of', 'this', 'is', 'when', 'the', 'young', 'boys', 'kill', 'the', 'Ravensteins', 'on', 'the', 'train', 'a', 'scene', 'shot', 'in', 'an', 'almost', 'political', 'poster', 'style', 'with', 'facial', 'close', 'ups', 'It', 'reminded', 'me', 'of', 'Battleship', 'Potemkin', 'that', 'intense', 'constant', 'style', 'coupled', 'with', 'the', 'spray', 'of', 'red', 'to', 'convey', 'tons', 'of', 'horror', 'without', 'much', 'gore', 'Same', 'with', 'the', 'scene', 'when', 'Katharina', 'finds', 'her', 'father', 'dead', 'in', 'the', 'bathtubyou', 'can', 'only', 'see', 'the', 'red', 'water', 'on', 'the', 'side', 'It', 'is', 'one', 'of', 'the', 'things', 'I', 'love', 'about', 'Von', 'Trier', 'his', 'understatement', 'of', 'horror', 'which', 'ends', 'up', 'making', 'it', 'all', 'the', 'more', 'creepybr', 'br', 'The', 'use', 'of', 'text', 'in', 'the', 'film', 'was', 'unique', 'like', 'when', 'Leos', 'character', 'is', 'pushed', 'by', 'the', 'word', 'Werewolf', 'I', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'like', 'that', 'in', 'a', 'filmbr', 'br', 'The', 'use', 'of', 'black', 'comedy', 'in', 'this', 'film', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'ErnstHugo', 'Järegård', 'is', 'great', 'as', 'Leos', 'uncle', 'It', 'brings', 'up', 'the', 'snickers', 'I', 'got', 'from', 'his', 'role', 'in', 'the', 'Kingdom', 'Riget', 'This', 'humor', 'makes', 'the', 'plotline', 'of', 'absurd', 'anal', 'retentiveness', 'of', 'train', 'conductors', 'against', 'the', 'terrible', 'backdrop', 'of', 'WW2', 'and', 'all', 'the', 'chaos', 'easier', 'to', 'take', 'It', 'reminds', 'me', 'of', 'Riget', 'in', 'the', 'way', 'the', 'hospital', 'administrator', 'is', 'trying', 'to', 'maintain', 'a', 'normalcy', 'at', 'the', 'end', 'of', 'part', 'one', 'when', 'everything', 'is', 'going', 'crazy', 'It', 'shows', 'that', 'some', 'people', 'are', 'truly', 'oblivious', 'to', 'the', 'awful', 'things', 'happening', 'around', 'them', 'Yet', 'some', 'people', 'like', 'Leo', 'are', 'tuned', 'in', 'but', 'do', 'nothing', 'positive', 'about', 'itbr', 'br', 'The', 'voice', 'over', 'done', 'expertly', 'well', 'by', 'Max', 'von', 'Sydow', 'is', 'amusing', 'too', 'It', 'draws', 'you', 'into', 'the', 'story', 'and', 'makes', 'you', 'jump', 'into', 'Leos', 'head', 'which', 'at', 'times', 'is', 'a', 'scary', 'place', 'to', 'bebr', 'br', 'The', 'movie', 'brings', 'up', 'the', 'point', 'that', 'one', 'is', 'a', 'coward', 'if', 'they', 'dont', 'choose', 'a', 'side', 'I', 'see', 'the', 'same', 'idea', 'used', 'in', 'Dancer', 'in', 'the', 'Dark', 'where', 'Bjorks', 'character', 'doesnt', 'speak', 'up', 'for', 'herself', 'and', 'ends', 'up', 'being', 'her', 'own', 'destruction', 'Actually', 'at', 'one', 'time', 'Von', 'Trier', 'seemed', 'antiwoman', 'to', 'me', 'by', 'making', 'Breaking', 'the', 'Waves', 'and', 'Dancer', 'but', 'now', 'I', 'know', 'his', 'male', 'characters', 'dont', 'fare', 'well', 'either', 'I', 'found', 'myself', 'at', 'the', 'same', 'place', 'during', 'the', 'end', 'of', 'Dancer', 'when', 'you', 'seriously', 'want', 'the', 'main', 'character', 'to', 'rethink', 'their', 'actions', 'but', 'of', 'course', 'they', 'never', 'do']}\n",
      "{'id': 12504, 'text': \"That was the first thing that sprang to mind as I watched the closing credits to Europa make there was across the screen, never in my entire life have I seen a film of such technical genius, the visuals of Europa are so impressive that any film I watch in it's wake will only pale in comparison, forget your Michael Bay, Ridley Scott slick Hollywood cinematography, Europa has more ethereal beauty than anything those two could conjure up in a million years. Now I'd be the first to hail Lars von Trier a genius just off the back of his films Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark, but this is stupid, the fact that Europa has gone un-noticed by film experts for so long is a crime against cinema, whilst overrated rubbish like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Life is Beautiful clean up at the academy awards (but what do the know) Europa has been hidden away, absent form video stores and (until recently) any British TV channels. <br /><br />The visuals in Europa are not MTV gloss; it's not a case of style over substance, its more a case of substance dictating style. Much like his first film The Element of Crime, von Trier uses the perspective of the main character to draw us into his world, and much like Element, the film begins with the main character (or in the case of Europa, we the audience) being hypnotized. As we move down the tracks, the voice of the Narrator (Max von Sydow) counts us down into a deep sleep, until we awake in Europa. This allows von Trier and his three cinematographers to pay with the conventions of time and imagery, there are many scenes in Europa when a character in the background, who is in black and white, will interact with a person in the foreground who will be colour, von Trier is trying to show us how much precedence the coloured item or person has over the plot, for instance, it's no surprise that the first shot of Leopold Kessler (Jean-marc Barr) is in colour, since he is the only character who's actions have superiority over the film. <br /><br />The performances are good, they may not be on par with performances in later von Trier films, but that's just because the images are sometimes so distracting that you don't really pick up on them the first time round. But I would like to point out the fantastic performance of Jean-Marc Barr in the lead role, whose blind idealism is slowly warn down by the two opposing sides, until he erupts in the films final act. Again, muck like The Element of Crime, the film ends with our hero unable to wake up from his nightmare state, left in this terrible place, with only the continuing narration of von Sydow to seal his fate. Europa is a tremendous film, and I cant help thinking what a shame that von Trier has abandoned this way of filming, since he was clearly one of the most talented visual directors working at that time, Europa, much like the rest of his cinematic cannon is filled with a wealth of iconic scenes. His dedication to composition and mise-en-scene is unrivalled, not to mention his use of sound and production design. But since his no-frills melodramas turned out to be Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark then who can argue, but it does seems like a waste of an imaginative talent. 10/10\", 'label': 1,

It covers loading a public dataset (IMDB reviews), converting it to a Ray Dataset, filtering and joining data, applying tokenization, and converting the results to a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis. The workflow highlights how Ray Data enables efficient data processing for machine learning pipelines, even with datasets that are too large for a single machine."
