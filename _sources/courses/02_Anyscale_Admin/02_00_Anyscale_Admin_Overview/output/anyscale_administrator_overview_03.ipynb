    "## 2. Cloud Deployment Types\n",
    "\n",
    "You can deploy Anyscale Clouds on different infrastructure types (virtual machines vs. Kubernetes), and can choose the way you deploy them (managed vs. custom).\n",

    "**\ud83d\udcdd Note**: All examples in this tutorial use `anyscale cloud register` to demonstrate full infrastructure control, including private subnets, custom VPCs, and detailed IAM configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following section provides a practical example demonstrating the resources that Anyscale requires for AWS EC2 deployment. This example serves as a starting point to help you understand the deployment process. For Kubernetes deployments, additional K8s components are required, which will be covered in the next course."
