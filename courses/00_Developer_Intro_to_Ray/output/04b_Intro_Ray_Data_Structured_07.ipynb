    "\n",
    "Here are some relevant upcoming features in Ray Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "For structured data:\n",
    "- improved `groupby` and `map_groups` performance\n",
    "- using parquet metadata for computing statistics like `count`\n",
    "- enabling predicate pushdown for parquet files when calling `filter`\n",
    "- supporting `join` and `merge` operations\n",
    "- optimizing performance of the `Preprocessor` API for distributed feature engineering\n",
    "- running spark on Ray more seamlessly\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For all data types:\n",
    "- data checkpointing for fault tolerance\n",
    "- optimizing data connectors\n",
    "- concurrent execution of multiple datasets"
