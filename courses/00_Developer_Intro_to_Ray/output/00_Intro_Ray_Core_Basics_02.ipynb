    "* distributing computation across many cores, nodes, or devices (e.g., accelerators)\n",
    "* scheduling *arbitrary task graphs*\n",
    "    * any code you can write, you can distribute, scale, and accelerate with Ray Core\n",
    "* managing the overhead\n",
    "    * At scale, distributed computation introduces growing \"frictions\":\n",
    "        * data-specific overhead: serialization/deserialization, transfer costs.\n",
    "        * scheduling overhead: managing the queue of tasks to run, deciding where to run them.\n",
    "        * system-specific overhead: garbage collection, memory management, etc.\n",
    "    * Ray Core addresses these issues as first-order concerns in its design via:\n",
    "        * a distributed scheduler\n",
    "        * distributed memory\n",
    "        * distributed reference counting\n",

    "For common technical use cases, Ray libraries and other components provide simple development experience and are built on top of Ray Core."
