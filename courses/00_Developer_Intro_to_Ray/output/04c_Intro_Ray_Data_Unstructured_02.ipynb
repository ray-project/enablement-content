    "| **Challenge** | **Details** | **Ray Data Solution** |\n",
    "|---------------|-------------|------------------------|\n",
    "| **Operating on large datasets and/or models** | - Having to load and process massive datasets or models (e.g., >10\u202fTB) <br>- Having to perform inference with large models (e.g., LLMs) using inference engines | - Distributes data loading and processing across a Ray cluster <br>- Supports large model inference workloads via [ray.data.llm](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/data/working-with-llms.html) |\n",
    "| **Efficient hardware utilization across CPUs and GPUs** | - Over-provisioning compute to naively partition data <br>- Performing static resource allocation <br>- Running execution in full across CPU and GPU stages <br>- Passing data between heteregenous stages by persisting intermediate results to disk  | - [Streams data](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/data/data-internals.html#streaming-execution) to avoid full materialization in memory <br>- Enables resource multiplexing across pipeline stages <br>- Supports autoscaling for both CPU and GPU resources <br>- Enables pipeline parallelism across heterogeneous hardware with [configurable batch sizes](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/data/api/doc/ray.data.Dataset.map_batches.html#ray-data-dataset-map-batches) |\n",
    "| **Building reliable pipelines** | - Needing to handle failures such as network errors, spot instance preemptions, and hardware faults | - Leverages [Ray Core\u2019s fault-tolerance mechanisms](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/fault-tolerance.html) to recover from failed tasks <br>- Supports [driver checkpointing](https://docs.anyscale.com/rayturbo/rayturbo-data/#job-level-checkpointing) (via RayTurbo) for comprehensive pipeline reliability |\n",
    "| **Handling unstructured data efficiently** | - Suboptimal resource allocation due to data skew in input data sizes (e.g. vary input video lengths)  | - Automatically [reshapes data into uniformly sized blocks](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/data/data-internals.html) to improve processing efficiency |\n"
