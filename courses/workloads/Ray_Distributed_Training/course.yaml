title: Distributed BERT Fine-Tuning with Ray Train
description: Learn to fine-tune a BERT sequence-classification model on the Yelp Reviews
  dataset using Ray Train with PyTorch and Hugging Face. You’ll build a scalable distributed
  training pipeline—covering tokenization, dataloaders, metrics, and per-worker training
  loops—that runs efficiently across CPUs/GPUs locally or on a Ray cluster.
