title: Distributed Diffusion Training with Ray Train V2
description: Learn to build and run an end-to-end mini diffusion (image denoising)
  pipeline on the Food-101-Lite dataset using Ray Train V2 on an Anyscale cluster.
  You’ll parallelize image decoding, preprocessing, and encoding with Ray Data and
  scale generative computer-vision model training across a distributed environment.
