title: Scalable Diffusion-Policy Training with Ray
description: Learn to build and run an end-to-end diffusion-policy training workload
  for the `Pendulum-v1` control task using a real offline dataset, from data generation
  and preprocessing with Ray Data to distributed training on an Anyscale cluster with
  Ray Train V2. You’ll migrate a local PyTorch + Gymnasium workflow into a scalable,
  fault-tolerant Ray pipeline with minimal code changes.
