title: Scaling Stable Diffusion Training with Ray Train
description: Learn when and how to use Ray Train to scale deep learning workloads
  by training a Stable Diffusion UNet with PyTorch Lightning. You’ll build a Parquet-backed
  PyTorch Dataset/DataLoader, establish a single-GPU baseline, and then scale the
  same training job to multi-GPU distributed training on a Ray cluster.
