  title: Workload
  description: In this module, you’ll learn when to use Ray Train to scale deep learning
    workloads and how to train a Stable Diffusion UNet with PyTorch Lightning. You’ll
    build a simple Parquet-backed PyTorch Dataset/DataLoader and run single-GPU training
    as a baseline before moving to distributed training on a multi-GPU Ray cluster.

      title: 'Introduction to Ray Train: Ray Train + PyTorch Lightning'
      description: Learn when to use Ray Train and how to integrate it with PyTorch
        Lightning to scale model training from a single GPU to a multi-GPU Ray cluster.
        You’ll apply this workflow by training a Stable Diffusion model using distributed
        training with Ray Train.

      title: When to use Ray Train
      description: Learn when to use Ray Train to speed up and scale machine learning
        training workloads that are slow or require significant compute. This lesson
        explains the key challenges Ray Train addresses and how its distributed training
        framework helps solve them.

      title: Single GPU Training with PyTorch Lightning
      description: In this lesson, you’ll set up single-GPU training for a Stable
        Diffusion UNet using PyTorch Lightning, starting from preprocessed image and
        text latents stored in Parquet. You’ll build a simple custom `Dataset` and
        `DataLoader`, validate batch shapes/dtypes, and define a LightningModule-ready
        UNet configuration for training.

      title: Distributed Training with Ray Train and PyTorch Lightning
      description: Learn how to scale a PyTorch Lightning image training loop from
        a single GPU to multi-GPU Distributed Data Parallel using Ray Train. You’ll
        migrate your code to a Ray Train–compatible training function, configure GPU
        scaling with `ScalingConfig`, and launch distributed runs with `TorchTrainer`
        while managing checkpoints and metrics.

      title: Ray Train in Production
      description: Learn how Ray Train is used in real-world production workflows
        through a case study showing how Canva combined Ray Train and Ray Data to
        reduce Stable Diffusion training costs by 3.7x. You’ll see practical patterns
        and outcomes for scaling training efficiently and cost-effectively.
