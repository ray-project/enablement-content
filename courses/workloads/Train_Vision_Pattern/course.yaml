title: Distributed Computer Vision Training with Ray Train
description: Build an end-to-end computer vision pipeline that loads and preprocesses
  the Food-101-Lite dataset and trains a ResNet-18 image classifier in PyTorch. Then
  migrate the workflow from single-node training to a fully distributed job on an
