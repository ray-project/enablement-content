title: Distributed Transformer Time-Series Forecasting Pipeline
description: Build an end-to-end time-series forecasting pipeline to predict NYC taxi
  demand for the next 24 hours from a week of historical data using a sequence-to-sequence
  Transformer. Then scale the solution from single-GPU PyTorch to distributed, multi-node
  training on an Anyscale cluster with Ray Train V2.
