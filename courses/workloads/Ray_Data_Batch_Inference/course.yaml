title: Scalable Batch Inference with Ray Data
description: Learn to run scalable batch inference with Ray Data by loading a Hugging
  Face dataset, converting it to a Ray Dataset, and generating SentenceTransformer
  embeddings in parallel with `map_batches`. You’ll optimize throughput by configuring
  batching, CPU/GPU/MPS device placement, and concurrency to efficiently materialize
  embeddings across an entire dataset.
