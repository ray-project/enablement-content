  title: Workload
  description: Learn how to build a scalable matrix factorization recommendation system
    on the MovieLens 100K dataset and migrate it from a local workflow to distributed,
    fault-tolerant training on an Anyscale cluster using Ray Train V2 and Ray Data.
    You’ll prepare the dataset (CSV/Parquet) and run end-to-end collaborative filtering
    training to predict user–item ratings.

      title: 04e Recommendation system pattern with Ray Train
      description: Learn how to build a scalable matrix factorization (collaborative
        filtering) recommendation system on the MovieLens 100K dataset. You’ll migrate
        a local pipeline to a distributed, fault-tolerant training workflow using
        Ray Train V2 and Ray Data on an Anyscale cluster.
    01_lesson:
      title: 1. Imports
      description: In this lesson, you’ll set up the notebook environment by installing
        required packages and importing the core libraries used throughout the tutorial
        (e.g., `pandas`, `matplotlib`, PyTorch, and Ray). By the end, you’ll have
        all dependencies loaded and ready for distributed data processing and model
        training.
    02_lesson:
      title: 7. Define matrix factorization model
      description: Learn how to implement a basic matrix factorization recommender
        in PyTorch by creating user and item embedding layers. You’ll predict ratings
        by taking the dot product of the corresponding user and item embeddings.
    03_lesson:
      title: 8. Define Ray Train loop (with validation, checkpointing, and Ray-managed
        metrics)
      description: Learn how to implement `train_loop_per_worker`, the core Ray Train
        worker function that performs distributed training with a validation pass
        each epoch. You’ll also add checkpointing and report Ray-managed metrics (e.g.,
        train/val loss) so results are automatically tracked and retrievable for analysis.
    04_lesson:
      title: 11. Resume training from checkpoint
      description: Learn how to resume a Ray `TorchTrainer` run by calling `trainer.fit()`
        again, automatically restoring the latest model state from persistent checkpoint
        storage. You’ll confirm that training continues seamlessly from the most recent
        saved checkpoint without manual reload steps.
