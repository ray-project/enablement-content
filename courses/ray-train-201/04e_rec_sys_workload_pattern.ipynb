    "### 🧭 How you’ll migrate this recommendation system workload to a distributed setup using Ray on Anyscale\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial walks through how to **migrate a local matrix factorization pipeline for recommendation into a distributed, fault-tolerant training loop using Ray Train and Ray Data on Anyscale**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how you approach the transition:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pandas DataFrame → Sharded Ray Dataset**  \n",
    "   Load MovieLens 100K as a pandas DataFrame, encode the IDs, and use `ray.data.from_pandas_refs()` to create a **multi-block Ray Dataset**. Each block is a training shard that Ray can distribute across workers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Manual Batching → Streaming Torch Data loaders**  \n",
    "   Instead of manually writing PyTorch `Dataset` logic, use `iter_torch_batches()` from **Ray Data** to stream batches directly into each worker. Ray handles all the parallelism and sharding behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Single-node PyTorch → Multi-GPU Distributed Training**  \n",
    "   Write a minimal `train_loop_per_worker` that runs on each Ray worker. Using `TorchTrainer` and `prepare_model()`, scale this loop across 8 GPU workers automatically, where each working on its own data shard.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Ad-hoc Logging → Structured Epoch Logging and Checkpoints**  \n",
    "   Each epoch logs `train_loss` and `val_loss` to a shared JSON file, and report checkpoints with `ray.train.report(checkpoint=...)`. This enables **automatic recovery and metric tracking** without any additional code.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Resume and Scaling → Declarative Configuration**  \n",
    "   Configure fault tolerance, checkpointing, and scaling using `ScalingConfig`, `CheckpointConfig`, and `FailureConfig`. This lets Ray + Anyscale handle retries, recovery, and GPU orchestration.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Post-training Inference → Lightweight Python Function**  \n",
    "   After training, load the latest checkpoint and generate top-N recommendations for any user with a simple forward pass. No retraining, no re-initialization, just pure PyTorch inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "With just a few changes to your core code, scale a traditional recommendation pipeline across a Ray cluster with **distributed data loading, checkpointing, fault tolerance, and parallel training**, all fully managed by Anyscale."

    "\n",
    "Here are a few directions you can explore to extend or adapt this workload:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ranking Metrics & Evaluation**  \n",
    "   * Add metrics like **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**, **Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)**, or **Hit@K** to evaluate recommendation quality.  \n",
    "   * Filter out already-rated items during inference to measure novelty.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Two-Tower and Deep Models**  \n",
    "   * Replace dot product with a **two-tower neural model** or a **deep MLP**.  \n",
    "   * Add side features (For example, timestamp, genre) into each tower for better personalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recommendation Personalization**  \n",
    "   * Store and cache user embeddings after training.  \n",
    "   * Run lightweight inference tasks to generate recommendations in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Content-Based or Hybrid Models**  \n",
    "   * Join movie metadata (genres, tags) and build a hybrid collaborative–content model.  \n",
    "   * Embed titles or genres using pre-trained language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Hyperparameter Optimization**  \n",
    "   * Use **Ray Tune** to sweep embedding sizes, learning rates, or regularization.  \n",
    "   * Track performance over epochs and checkpoint the best models automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Data Scaling**  \n",
    "   * Switch from MovieLens 100K to 1M or 10M as Ray Data handles it seamlessly.  \n",
    "   * Save and load from cloud object storage (S3, GCS) for real-world deployments.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Production Inference**  \n",
    "   * Wrap the recommendation system into a **Ray Serve** endpoint for serving top-N results.  \n",
    "   * Build a simple demo that recommends movies to live users.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **End-to-End MLOps**  \n",
    "   * Register the best model with MLflow or Weights & Biases.  \n",
    "   * Package the training job as a Ray Job and schedule it with Anyscale.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Multi-tenant recommendation systems**  \n",
    "   * Extend this to support **multiple audiences** or contexts (For example, multi-country, A/B groups).  \n",
    "   * Train and serve context-aware models in parallel using Ray.\n",
