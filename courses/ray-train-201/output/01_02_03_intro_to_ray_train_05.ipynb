    "- **`num_epochs`** \u2192 how many full passes through the dataset to run.  \n",
    "- **`global_batch_size`** \u2192 the total batch size across all workers (Ray will split this evenly across GPUs).  \n",
    "\n",
    "You can add other parameters here (like `learning_rate`, `embedding_dim`, etc.) and they\u2019ll automatically be accessible in your training loop via `config[\"param_name\"]`.  \n"
