    "## 11 \u00b7 Resume Training from Checkpoint  \n",
    "Run `trainer.fit()` again to resume training from the most recent checkpoint. Since `TorchTrainer` was originally configured with `resume_from_checkpoint=True` and a persistent `storage_path`, Ray automatically restores the latest saved model state and continues training from the correct epoch.\n",

    "This demonstrates Ray Train\u2019s built-in support for fault tolerance and iterative experimentation, allowing training to pick up exactly where it left off without manual intervention."
