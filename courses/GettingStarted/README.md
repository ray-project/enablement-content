# Anyscale 101 Learning Path

Developing scalable AI applications in the cloud is inherently complex. In addition to managing data, algorithms, and code, teams often face the added burden of handling compute infrastructure, DevOps, and distributed systems.

##  Introduction: Why Anyscale?

**Ray**, a fast-growing open-source framework, simplifies this challenge by providing a Python-native API for building scalable and distributed AI Applications. 

Thatâ€™s where **Anyscale** comes in. The **Anyscale Platform** provides a fully managed, cloud-native environment that makes it easy to develop and scale Ray applications, without the overhead of managing infrastructure.

**The diagram below illustrates how Anyscale supports AI workloads in any environment.** By abstracting away the complexity of compute environments, data formats, and frameworks, Anyscale provides a unified platform that runs seamlessly on any cloud, accelerator, or hardware stack.

## Learning Path Overview and Objectives

The goal of this learning path is to provide an introductory, hands-on experience in building applications on the Anyscale Platform, with a focus on key considerations for developing scalable AI/ML workloads. Weâ€™ll begin by exploring the typical interactive development lifecycle on Anyscale Workspaces, then move on to productionizing workflows using Jobs and Services, and finally wrap up with tools for collaboration and organizational management.
