    "# 101 --  Introduction to Anyscale Services\n",
    "\n",
    "**Anyscale Services** utilizes **Ray Serve** to provide a managed experience for deploying performant, scalable and reliable services. Each **Anyscale Service** runs on its own dedicated Ray cluster. Anyscale will also manage the infrastructure around a service, enabling autoscaling, high availability, observability, and zero-downtime upgrades.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key characteristics of Anyscale Services\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Autoscaling:** Scale automatically based on demand\n",
    "- **High Availiability / Resilient:** Tolerate node or process failures gracefully\n",
    "- **Mature Deployment Strategies:** Roll out updates incrementally with traffic shifting\n",
    "- **Enterprise Ready:** Integrate easily with Grafana dashboards and alerting systems\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### This notebook covers the following:\n",
    "- Creating and modifying a simple **Ray Serve + FastAPI** application\n",
    "- Configuring and deploying the Anyscale Service using a `service.yaml` file\n",
    "- Validating deployment from the **Anyscale Console** and querying the endpoint"
