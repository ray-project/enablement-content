  title: Landscape
  description: This module maps the distributed data and compute industry landscape,
    covering the data, compute, and orchestration layers and the tools commonly used
    in each. You’ll learn how these layers fit together and how to categorize major
    distributed computing frameworks and commercial platforms by their primary use
    cases.

      title: 'Introduction to Ray Data: Industry Landscape'
      description: Learn how the modern distributed data ecosystem is organized across
        the data, compute, and orchestration layers, including common tools and commercial
        platforms. You’ll also understand how data storage patterns have evolved and
        how these layers work together to execute distributed workloads.
    01_lesson:
      title: The Compute Layer
      description: Learn how the compute layer is organized by function and how different
        types of compute support key workflows. You’ll be able to distinguish compute
        used for tasks like data engineering (transforming datasets) and understand
        where it fits in the overall system.
    02_lesson:
      title: The Orchestration Layer
      description: Learn how the orchestration layer coordinates multi-stage compute
        using workflow engines and orchestration platforms. You’ll get introduced
        to common tools used to schedule, manage, and monitor these pipelines end
        to end.
    03_lesson:
      title: Distributed Computing Frameworks
      description: Learn how distributed computing frameworks scale data processing
        by splitting workloads across clusters, and how they differ across batch,
        stream, and general-purpose use cases. You’ll also examine common challenges
        in JVM-based systems like Spark and Flink, including how their execution and
        data flow can impact performance.
    04_lesson:
      title: Data Processing with Ray Data
      description: Learn what Ray Data is and how it enables high-performance, distributed
        data processing. You’ll see how it supports efficient “last-mile” transformations
        that integrate smoothly with model training workflows.
    05_lesson:
      title: Ray Serve
      description: Learn what Ray Serve is and how it enables scalable, distributed
        ML inference services. You’ll also understand the end-to-end request lifecycle
        and data flow through a Ray Serve deployment.
