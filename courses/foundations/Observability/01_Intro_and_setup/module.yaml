  title: Intro And Setup
  description: Learn the fundamentals of observability—metrics, logs, and traces—and
    how they help you monitor and debug distributed systems. Then set up local Ray
    observability by installing Ray, launching Prometheus and Grafana, starting a
    two-node Ray cluster, and using the Ray Dashboard to verify and explore collected
    metrics.

      title: Observability Introduction
      description: Learn the fundamentals of observability and why it matters for
        distributed systems. Set up Ray observability on your local machine to start
        monitoring and troubleshooting Ray workloads.
    01_lesson:
      title: Observability Overview
      description: Learn what observability is and how it helps you understand and
        improve software behavior. You’ll identify the key telemetry types—especially
        metrics such as system and cluster performance data—and what they reveal about
        your applications.
    02_lesson:
      title: Setting Up Local Ray Observability
      description: Learn how to set up local Ray observability by installing Ray,
        launching Prometheus and Grafana, and starting a two-node Ray cluster (head
        + worker) with metrics enabled. By the end, you’ll be able to use the Ray
        Dashboard and Grafana to monitor and debug local Ray workloads for later course
        examples.
