  title: Ray Anyscale Observability In Detail
  description: Learn how to monitor and debug Ray workloads using Ray and Anyscale
    observability dashboards, with hands-on examples that show when to use each view.
    You’ll explore Ray Data pipeline execution status, logs, and metrics (and Anyscale-specific
    workload dashboards) to identify bottlenecks and operational issues.

      title: Ray and Anyscale Observability in Detail
      description: Learn how to use Ray and Anyscale observability dashboards to monitor
        workloads and diagnose issues. You’ll see practical examples of when to use
        each dashboard for effective debugging and performance troubleshooting.

      title: Data Pipeline Observability (Ray Data)
      description: Learn how to monitor and debug Ray Data pipelines using Ray/Anyscale
        observability tools, including the Jobs view, Ray Data Overview, logs, and
        metrics dashboards. You’ll run a simple pipeline and interpret operator-level
        states, block outputs, backpressure signals, and throughput/resource metrics.

      title: Web Application Observability (Ray Serve)
      description: Learn how to deploy a Ray Serve web application, generate HTTP
        traffic, and monitor its behavior using Ray Serve observability tools. You’ll
        explore key metrics in Grafana (e.g., QPS and error rates), configure and
        inspect logs, and understand options for end-to-end request tracing (Anyscale).
