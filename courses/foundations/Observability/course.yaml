title: Ray Observability Fundamentals and Setup
description: Learn the core observability pillars—metrics, logs, and traces—and how
  they’re used to monitor and debug distributed systems. You’ll then set up local
  Ray observability by deploying Prometheus and Grafana, starting a two-node Ray cluster,
  and using the Ray Dashboard to validate and explore collected metrics.
