  title: Batch Inference
  description: Learn how to use Ray Data to ingest a large image dataset from cloud
    storage, enrich each record with labels, and run scalable batch inference by generating
    CLIP embeddings with `map_batches`. You’ll see how to structure preprocessing
    and model execution for efficient, streaming, distributed batch pipelines.

    00_lesson:
      title: Batch inference
      description: Learn how to run batch inference by setting up the required environment
        and dependencies, then executing model predictions over many inputs efficiently.
        You’ll be able to install and configure the project (including optional uv
        workflow) and prepare your notebook for large-scale inference runs.
    01_lesson:
      title: Data ingestion
      description: Learn how to ingest an image dataset from a public S3 bucket using
        Ray Data, triggering lazy execution to efficiently load samples. You’ll also
        extract and attach class labels from file paths by mapping a transformation
        over the dataset.
    02_lesson:
      title: Batch embeddings
      description: Learn how to generate image embeddings at scale by applying a CLIP
        model over dataset batches using Ray Data’s `map_batches`. You’ll configure
        batch size, concurrency, and GPU usage, and use Ray’s object store references
        to avoid reloading the model for each worker.
    03_lesson:
      title: Ray Data
      description: Learn how Ray Data simplifies distributing and streaming data workloads
        while maximizing efficiency through heterogeneous CPU/GPU scheduling and scaling
        to massive datasets (including LLM pipelines). You’ll also see how RayTurbo
        Data extends Ray Data with faster metadata fetching and optimized autoscaling
        for quicker job startup and throughput.
    04_lesson:
      title: Data storage
      description: Learn how to persist generated embeddings to shared artifact storage
        on Anyscale by writing them as Parquet files and managing existing directories.
        You’ll also understand when to use object storage versus a vector database
        for longer-term, searchable embedding storage.
    05_lesson:
      title: Monitoring and Debugging
      description: Learn how to monitor and debug Ray workloads using built-in logs
        and the Ray observability dashboard to track resource usage and inspect task-level
        execution. You’ll also see how Anyscale enhances Ray’s observability features
        to make troubleshooting faster and easier.
    06_lesson:
      title: Production jobs
      description: Learn how to package a production batch workload—like embedding
        generation—into an Anyscale Job by specifying the run command, compute resources,
        dependencies, and working directory. You’ll then submit and manage the job
        using the Anyscale CLI and configuration YAML.
    07_lesson:
      title: Similar images
      description: Learn how to embed a new image with a CLIP model and use cosine
        similarity to retrieve the most similar images from a precomputed embeddings
        dataset. You’ll implement the full workflow—from loading an image URL to ranking
        and displaying the top matches.
