title: Ray Core Distributed Tasks Fundamentals
description: Learn the fundamentals of Ray Core by converting Python functions into
  distributed tasks with `@ray.remote`, running them in parallel with `.remote()`,
  and collecting results with `ray.get`. You’ll build and execute your own remote
  task and learn how to avoid the common anti-pattern of calling `ray.get` in a loop
  to maintain parallel performance.
