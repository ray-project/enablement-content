  title: Basics
  description: Learn the fundamentals of Ray Core by turning Python functions into
    distributed tasks with `@ray.remote`, executing them in parallel with `.remote()`,
    and retrieving results using `ray.get`. You’ll practice by writing and running
    your own remote task and learn a key anti-pattern to avoid (`ray.get` in a loop)
    to preserve parallelism.

      title: 'Introduction to Ray Core: Getting Started'
      description: This lesson gives a step-by-step tour of Ray Core fundamentals,
        showing you how to create and run remote functions for distributed execution.
        You’ll learn how to execute tasks and retrieve results, whether running locally
        or on a Ray cluster in the cloud.

      title: 0. Overview
      description: This lesson introduces Ray Core and explains how it enables you
        to scale Python applications with distributed computing. You’ll learn what
        Ray is, where it fits in the Python ecosystem, and what problems it helps
        solve.

      title: 1. Creating Remote Functions
      description: Learn how to convert a standard Python function into a Ray remote
        function using the `@ray.remote` decorator, enabling it to run as a distributed
        task on any process in your cluster. You’ll understand how remote, stateless
        task invocations work in Ray.

      title: 2. Executing Remote Functions
      description: Learn how to execute Ray remote functions as distributed tasks
        using the `.remote()` suffix instead of a normal Python call. You’ll see how
        Ray schedules the work on the cluster and immediately returns an `ObjectRef`
        representing the future result.

      title: 4. Putting It All Together
      description: 'Learn how to complete the full Ray task workflow: define a `@ray.remote`
        function, execute it asynchronously, and retrieve results with `ray.get`.
        You’ll practice by building and running a `sqrt_add` task and learn why calling
        `ray.get` inside a loop can reduce parallelism.'
