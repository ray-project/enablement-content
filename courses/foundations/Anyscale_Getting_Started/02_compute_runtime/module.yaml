  description: Learn how to build and register container images in Anyscale to standardize
    dependencies and runtime settings, then create compute configs that define instance
    types and autoscaling behavior for Ray clusters. You’ll apply these settings by
    updating an Anyscale Workspace and validating the environment with a simple runtime
    test.

      description: Learn how to create and use Anyscale container images and compute
        configs to standardize your Ray execution environment, manage dependencies,
        and choose cluster hardware and scaling options. By the end, you’ll update
        an Anyscale Workspace to run on your custom image and compute configuration
        and verify it in a notebook.
