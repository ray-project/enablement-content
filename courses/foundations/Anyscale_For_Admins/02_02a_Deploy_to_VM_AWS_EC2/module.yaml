  title: 02A Deploy To Vm Aws Ec2
  description: Learn how to deploy Anyscale Ray on AWS EC2 using the `anyscale cloud
    register` workflow by setting up prerequisites, provisioning required AWS/Anyscale
    resources with Terraform, and registering the resulting cloud in Anyscale. By
    the end, you’ll have an EC2-backed Anyscale cloud ready for Ray installation and
    cluster use.

      title: 'Introduction: Deploy Anyscale Ray on AWS EC2 Instances'
      description: Learn how to deploy Anyscale Ray on AWS EC2 using the custom `anyscale
        cloud register` workflow, from setting up prerequisites (AWS CLI, credentials,
        Terraform) to completing the Ray installation and initial configuration.
    01_lesson:
      title: 1. Create Anyscale Resources with Terraform
      description: In this lesson, you’ll configure Terraform variables (via `variables.tf`
        and optional `terraform.tfvars`) and run `terraform init/plan/apply` to provision
        the required Anyscale resources in AWS. You’ll also learn to capture the `terraform
        apply` outputs needed to register your Anyscale cloud and troubleshoot common
        AWS service limit issues.
    02_lesson:
      title: 2. Register the Anyscale Cloud
      description: In this lesson, you’ll log into Anyscale and use your `terraform
        apply` outputs to register a new Anyscale Cloud via the `anyscale cloud register`
        command. By the end, you’ll have a successfully created cloud with your chosen
        `ANYSCALE_CLOUD_NAME`.
    03_lesson:
      title: 3. Test
      description: Learn how to validate your newly created Anyscale cluster by submitting
        a test job from the terminal and checking its status and logs in the Anyscale
        Console. You’ll also know where to view job results under **Jobs** in the
        console.
    04_lesson:
      title: 4. Cleanup
      description: Learn how to safely clean up your Anyscale-on-AWS setup by removing
        the Terraform-provisioned resources (VPC/subnets, IAM roles, S3, EFS, and
        related components). By the end, you’ll know how to tear down the environment
        to avoid ongoing AWS costs.
