  title: Anyscale Admin Overview
  description: Learn how to set up and manage an Anyscale Cloud in your own infrastructure,
    including deployment options (VMs vs. Kubernetes, managed vs. custom) and the
    resources required to run Ray clusters. You’ll also walk through an AWS EC2 example
    that explains key components like IAM roles and other foundational cloud resources,
    typically provisioned via the Anyscale CLI or Terraform.

      title: Anyscale Administrator Overview
      description: Learn how to set up and administer Anyscale in your infrastructure,
        including an overview of Anyscale Clouds, deployment types, and required resources.
        You’ll also walk through an example EC2 deployment using the Anyscale CLI
        to understand how an Anyscale Cloud is configured.
    01_lesson:
      title: 1. What is an Anyscale Cloud?
      description: Learn what an Anyscale Cloud is and how it abstracts and manages
        the infrastructure needed to run Ray clusters. You’ll understand its role
        as an isolated deployment layer between your Anyscale organization and the
        Ray projects you create.
    02_lesson:
      title: 2. Cloud Deployment Types
      description: Learn how to deploy Anyscale Clouds across different infrastructure
        options—virtual machines or Kubernetes—and choose the right deployment model
        (managed vs. custom) for your environment. You'll understand the supported
        platforms for each infrastructure type and how these choices impact setup
        and operations.
    03_lesson:
      title: 3. A Demonstrative Example of Resource Creation with AWS EC2
      description: Learn how to deploy Anyscale on AWS EC2 by creating the required
        cloud resources, guided by the “Architecture of an Anyscale Cloud runs on
        AWS EC2” diagram. You’ll see how modular Terraform components (e.g., the required
        `aws-anyscale-iam` module) provision IAM roles and policies for secure cross-account
        access.
    04_lesson:
      title: 3.1 IAM Role Definition
      description: Learn how to deploy an Anyscale cloud by defining and creating
        the two required AWS IAM roles, including the Anyscale control plane role.
        You’ll understand who assumes each role and what permissions and trust relationships
        are needed for Anyscale to manage your resources securely.
    05_lesson:
      title: 4. Register Anyscale Cloud to Your Cloud Provider
      description: Learn how to register your AWS infrastructure (VPC, subnets, S3
        bucket, and IAM roles) as an Anyscale Cloud deployment using the `anyscale
        cloud register` CLI command. By the end, you’ll have a unified Anyscale Cloud
        configured to run on your AWS account.
