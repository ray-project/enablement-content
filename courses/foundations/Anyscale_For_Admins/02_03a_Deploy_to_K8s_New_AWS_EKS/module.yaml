  title: 03A Deploy To K8S New Aws Eks
  description: Learn how to deploy Anyscale Ray by creating a new AWS EKS–backed Anyscale
    Cloud using Terraform and required AWS tooling. You’ll configure prerequisites,
    provision the necessary AWS/Anyscale resources, then register the cloud with `anyscale
    cloud register` using the Terraform outputs.

      title: 'Introduction: Deploy Anyscale Ray on A New AWS EKS Cluster'
      description: Learn how to deploy Anyscale Cloud (Ray) on a brand-new AWS EKS
        cluster using the `anyscale cloud register` workflow. This lesson walks you
        through prerequisites, required tooling (AWS CLI, Terraform), and the AWS
        account/VPC/IAM setup needed to complete the deployment.
    01_lesson:
      title: 1. Create Anyscale Resources with Terraform
      description: Learn how to configure Terraform variables and run `init`, `plan`,
        and `apply` to provision the required Anyscale resources on AWS (EKS). You’ll
        also capture the `terraform apply` outputs—especially the Anyscale cloud registration
        command—needed for the next setup step.
    02_lesson:
      title: 2. Install Kubernetes Components
      description: Learn how to install and configure the core Kubernetes add-ons
        required by the Anyscale Operator on EKS—Cluster Autoscaler, AWS Load Balancer
        Controller, and NGINX Ingress Controller—using `kubectl` and Helm. You’ll
        also understand when and how to add the optional NVIDIA device plugin for
        GPU-enabled nodes.
    03_lesson:
      title: 3. Register the Anyscale Cloud
      description: In this lesson, you’ll log into Anyscale and use your Terraform
        apply outputs to register a new Anyscale Cloud via the `anyscale cloud register`
        command. By the end, you’ll have a named cloud successfully created and ready
        for use in Anyscale.
    04_lesson:
      title: 4. Install the Anyscale Operator
      description: Learn how to add the Anyscale Helm chart repository and use Helm
        to install or upgrade the Anyscale Operator in your Kubernetes cluster, configuring
        it with your cloud deployment ID. By the end, you’ll have the operator deployed
        and ready to manage Anyscale resources.
    05_lesson:
      title: 5. Verify the Installation
      description: Learn how to confirm your Anyscale installation is working by verifying
        that the Anyscale/Ray operator pods are running in Kubernetes and that your
        Anyscale cloud is properly registered using `kubectl` and the `anyscale` CLI.
    06_lesson:
      title: 6. Test
      description: Submit a sample job to validate your newly created Anyscale Kubernetes
        cluster, then monitor its status and logs from the CLI and Anyscale Console.
        You’ll also observe autoscaling behavior in Kubernetes and learn how the job’s
        compute configuration defines the Ray head and worker node resources.
    07_lesson:
      title: 7. Clean up
      description: Learn how to fully tear down your Anyscale setup by deleting the
        cloud, verifying removal, and emptying the associated S3 bucket. You’ll also
        uninstall the Anyscale operator and related Kubernetes resources (including
        optional ingress components) to prevent ongoing costs and leftover infrastructure.
    08_lesson:
      title: 8. Conclusion
      description: Wrap up the setup by confirming your Anyscale environment is successfully
        running on an existing AWS EKS cluster. You’ll review the AWS resources provisioned
        with Terraform and the key Kubernetes components installed (Cluster Autoscaler,
        AWS Load Balancer Controller, and NGINX Ingress).
