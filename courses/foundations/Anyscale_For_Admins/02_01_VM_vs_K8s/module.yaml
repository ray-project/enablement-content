  title: Vm Vs K8S
  description: Learn how Anyscale deploys Ray on either Virtual Machines or Kubernetes,
    including what the Anyscale Operator manages on K8s. Compare VM vs. K8s across
    control, data, and execution layers to choose the right deployment model for your
    infrastructure and automation needs.

      title: 'Deployment Options: Virtual Machines vs. Kubernetes'
      description: Learn how to deploy and manage Ray workloads on your existing Kubernetes
        infrastructure using the Anyscale Operator, a Kubernetes-native controller
        that provisions and orchestrates Ray clusters. You’ll understand when Kubernetes
        is a better fit than virtual machines and what the operator handles for you
        in production.

      title: 2. Virtual Machines (VM) vs. Kubernetes (K8s)
      description: Learn the key differences between VM-based and Kubernetes-based
        Anyscale deployments across the control, data, and workload execution layers.
        By the end, you’ll be able to choose the right option for your use case based
        on automation needs, required cloud/K8s access, and operational responsibilities.

      title: 3. (Optional) More Kubernetes Deployments Components
      description: Learn how Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler and a load balancer controller
        extend Ray deployments by automatically scaling cluster nodes and enabling
        external access to Ray applications. You’ll also preview VM-based deployment
        options on AWS EC2 and GCP GCE using the Ray autoscaler.
