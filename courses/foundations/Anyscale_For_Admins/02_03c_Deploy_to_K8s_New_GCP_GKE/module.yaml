  title: 03C Deploy To K8S New Gcp Gke
  description: Learn how to deploy Anyscale Ray on a brand-new Google Kubernetes Engine
    (GKE) cluster using the `anyscale cloud register` workflow. You’ll configure GCP
    authentication and required APIs, provision the GKE infrastructure with Terraform,
    and capture the registration output needed to connect the cluster to Anyscale.

    01_lesson:
      title: Prerequisites
      description: Learn what you need to have in place before deploying Anyscale
        Ray on a new GKE cluster, including creating a Google Cloud project and installing/configuring
        the required tools (Google Cloud SDK/CLI and Terraform 1.9+). You’ll also
        see an alternative Terraform setup option using `tfenv` if Homebrew installation
        isn’t available.
    02_lesson:
      title: 1. Installation
      description: Learn how to set up Google Cloud authentication and configuration
        for your deployment by adding `gcloud` to your PATH, logging in with application
        default credentials, and setting your project and region. You’ll also enable
        and verify the required GCP APIs (e.g., GKE, Compute, Storage, IAM) needed
        to proceed.
    03_lesson:
      title: 2. Create Anyscale Resources with Terraform
      description: In this lesson, you’ll configure `terraform.tfvars` and use Terraform
        to initialize, plan, and apply the deployment that provisions the required
        GKE infrastructure for Anyscale. You’ll also capture the `terraform apply`
        output needed to register your Anyscale cloud with your GCP environment.
    04_lesson:
      title: 3. Troubleshooting GPU Availability
      description: Learn how to diagnose and resolve GPU availability errors in GCP
        by checking accelerator availability per zone (e.g., T4 GPUs) and updating
        your Terraform configuration to target zones where the required GPUs are available.
    05_lesson:
      title: 4. kubectl Configuration
      description: Learn how to configure `kubectl` to authenticate with and connect
        to a GKE cluster using the GKE auth plugin and `gcloud` credentials. You’ll
        verify cluster access and then install and validate the NGINX Ingress Controller
        via Helm to enable external traffic routing.
    06_lesson:
      title: 5. Install NGINX Ingress Controller
      description: In this lesson, you’ll install/upgrade the Anyscale CLI and required
        GCP dependencies, verify the installation, and log in to Anyscale. You’ll
        then register your Anyscale Cloud using the outputs from `terraform apply`
        and a provided `anyscale cloud register` command.
    07_lesson:
      title: 6. (Optional) Upgrade Anyscale Dependencies
      description: Learn how to upgrade/install the Anyscale Operator and related
        dependencies on your Kubernetes cluster using Helm. You’ll also validate the
        setup by submitting a test job and then clean up by uninstalling Helm releases
        and deleting Anyscale cloud resources.
