  title: 02B Deploy To Vm Gcp Gce
  description: Learn how to deploy Anyscale Ray on GCP Compute Engine (GCE) by configuring
    GCP authentication and required APIs, provisioning infrastructure with the official
    Anyscale Terraform modules, and registering the resulting Anyscale cloud using
    the `anyscale cloud register` workflow.

      title: 'Introduction: Deploy Anyscale Ray on GCP Compute Engine Instances (GCE)'
      description: Learn how to set up the required GCP Compute Engine (GCE) infrastructure
        and Anyscale resources to deploy Ray on GCP. This lesson walks you through
        using the custom `anyscale cloud register` method to register and configure
        your cloud environment for deployment.
    01_lesson:
      title: Prerequisites
      description: In this lesson, you’ll set up the required Google Cloud environment
        by creating a Google Cloud Project and installing and configuring the Google
        Cloud SDK/CLI so you’re ready to follow along with the rest of the course.
    02_lesson:
      title: 1. Installation
      description: Learn how to authenticate with Google Cloud using application default
        credentials, set your active GCP project, and enable and verify the required
        APIs needed for deployment.
    03_lesson:
      title: 2. Create Anyscale Resources with Terraform
      description: In this lesson, you’ll configure Terraform variables (`terraform.tfvars`)
        and use the official Anyscale Terraform modules to provision the required
        Anyscale resources on GCP. You’ll run `terraform init/plan/apply` and capture
        the registration command output needed to register your Anyscale cloud.
    04_lesson:
      title: 3. Register the Anyscale Cloud
      description: In this lesson, you’ll log into Anyscale and use your `terraform
        apply` outputs to register a new Anyscale Cloud via the `anyscale cloud register`
        command. By the end, you’ll have a named Anyscale Cloud successfully created
        and ready to use.
    05_lesson:
      title: 4. Test
      description: Learn how to validate your newly created Anyscale cluster by submitting
        a test job from the command line. You’ll also learn how to monitor job status
        and view logs and results in the Anyscale Console.
    06_lesson:
      title: 5. Cleanup
      description: Learn how to safely tear down your Ray cluster and remove associated
        Anyscale cloud resources when you’re finished. You’ll also optionally empty
        and delete the GCS bucket to avoid lingering costs.
