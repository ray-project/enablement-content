This is fundamentally different from training models - serving focuses on making models available, scalable, and performant for end users.\n",

        "1. **Tokenization**: Input text is converted into tokens (words, subwords, or characters)\n",
        "2. **Processing**: The model processes these tokens to understand context\n",
