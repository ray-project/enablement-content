  title: Tune
  description: In this module, you’ll learn how to use Ray Tune to run distributed
    hyperparameter tuning, starting from a baseline PyTorch MNIST training loop and
    scaling experiments across available GPUs. By the end, you’ll be able to define
    a Tune training function, specify a search space, and execute parallel trials
    to find better-performing model configurations.

      title: Introduction to Ray Tune
      description: Learn how to perform hyperparameter tuning with Ray Tune by building
        a baseline PyTorch training workflow on MNIST and then scaling experiments
        efficiently on a Ray cluster. By the end, you’ll be able to set up data loading,
        define a model/training loop, and run distributed tuning runs to find better
        configurations faster.
    01_lesson:
      title: 1. Loading the data
      description: Learn how to download and load the MNIST handwritten digits dataset
        in PyTorch by building a normalized, shuffled `DataLoader`. You’ll also visualize
        a sample batch of images and labels to verify the data pipeline.
    02_lesson:
      title: 2. Starting out with vanilla PyTorch
      description: Learn how to build and train a simple MNIST digit classifier in
        “vanilla” PyTorch, including setting up the model, loss, data loading, and
        accuracy evaluation. You’ll also run the training on GPU by submitting the
        training loop as a Ray Core remote task.
    03_lesson:
      title: 3. Hyperparameter tuning with Ray Tune
      description: Learn how to use Ray Tune to run distributed hyperparameter searches
        by writing a Tune-compatible training function, configuring a `Tuner` with
        a parameter space and optimization metric, and retrieving the best-performing
        configuration. You’ll also understand core Ray Tune concepts like trials,
        resource allocation, and search strategies to scale tuning beyond sequential
        runs.

      title: 4. Ray Tune in Production
      description: Learn how to retrieve the best hyperparameter tuning result and
        its configuration from Ray Tune runs, then explore real-world production use
        cases of Ray Tune at companies like Uber and Spotify.
