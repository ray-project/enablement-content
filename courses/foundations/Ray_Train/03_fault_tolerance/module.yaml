  title: Fault Tolerance
  description: Learn how to make Ray Train jobs resilient to worker or node failures
    by adding checkpoint loading/saving (model, optimizer, epoch) to your training
    loop. You’ll also configure automatic retries with `FailureConfig` and run training
    that can recover and resume after interruptions.

      title: 01 · Modify Training Loop to Enable Checkpoint Loading
      description: Learn how to update a Ray Train training loop to load from checkpoints
        so jobs can resume after failures. You’ll implement checkpoint-aware recovery
        to enable fault-tolerant training with automatic retries or manual restoration.
    02_lesson:
      title: 02 · Save Full Checkpoint with Extra State
      description: Learn how to extend a Ray Train training loop to detect and load
        an existing checkpoint via `ray.train.get_checkpoint()` so training can resume
        after interruptions. You’ll restore key state (e.g., model and optimizer)
        to enable fault-tolerant continuation.

      title: 04 · Launch Fault-Tolerant Training
      description: Learn how to make a Ray Train training loop fault-tolerant by loading
        from checkpoints and saving full recovery state (model weights, optimizer
        state, and current epoch). You’ll also configure `FailureConfig` to enable
        automatic retries so training can resume after worker or node failures.
    04_lesson:
      title: 05 · Manual Restoration from Checkpoints
      description: Learn how to manually restore a Ray Train job from saved checkpoints
        after a failure or interruption. You’ll practice selecting the right checkpoint
        and restarting training so it resumes from the last saved state instead of
        starting over.

      title: 07 · Clean Up Cluster Storage
      description: Learn how to run a fault-tolerant Ray training job with checkpointing
        and automatic retries, then manually restore and resume training from the
        latest saved checkpoint by recreating a `TorchTrainer` with the same configuration.
        You’ll verify the resumed run continues where it left off—or exits immediately
        if training already completed.

      title: 🎉 Wrapping Up & Next Steps
      description: Learn how to clean up persistent cluster storage by deleting tutorial
        artifacts such as the downloaded MNIST dataset, training output directories,
        and the generated Parquet dataset. By the end, you’ll safely remove these
        paths to free space and leave your environment tidy for next steps.

      title: Lesson 7
      description: 'In Lesson 7, you’ll recap and consolidate what you built across
        the course: a production-style training workflow using Ray Train on Anyscale,
        extended with Ray Data. You’ll also review how you added fault tolerance and
        identify next steps for applying these patterns in your own projects.'
