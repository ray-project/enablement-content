title: Distributed PyTorch Training with Ray Train V2
description: Learn to use Ray Train V2 to run distributed PyTorch data-parallel (DDP)
  training on an Anyscale cluster by training a ResNet-18 model on MNIST across multiple
  GPUs. You’ll also learn when to use Ray Train and how to set up scalable training
  workflows with data loading, visualization, checkpointing, and metric reporting.
