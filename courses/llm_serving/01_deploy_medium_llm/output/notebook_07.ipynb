    "## Summary & Outlook\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to deploy a medium-sized LLM with Ray Serve LLM. Let's summarize what we've covered and look ahead to other possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Accomplished\n",
    "\n",
    "**Module 2 Summary:**\n",
    "1. **Overview**: Understood why medium-sized models (70B parameters) are ideal for production workloads\n",
    "2. **Configuration**: Set up Ray Serve LLM with tensor parallelism across 8 GPUs\n",
    "3. **Local Deployment**: Deployed locally and tested with various inference scenarios\n",
    "4. **Anyscale Services**: Deployed to production with zero code changes\n",
    "5. **Advanced Topics**: Enabled monitoring, optimized concurrency\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No Code Changes**: Same configuration works locally and in production\n",
    "- **Tensor Parallelism**: Essential for medium models to distribute across multiple GPUs\n",
    "- **Production Ready**: Anyscale Services provide enterprise-grade deployment\n",
    "- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive dashboards for performance optimization\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Multiple optimization strategies for different use cases\n",
    "\n",
    "### Related Examples & Templates\n",
    "\n",
    "Ray provides many more examples for different scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ray Documentation Examples:**\n",
    "- [Deploy a small-sized LLM](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/tutorials/deployment-serve-llm/small-size-llm/README.html) - 1-2 GPUs, prototyping\n",
    "- [Deploy a large-sized LLM](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/tutorials/deployment-serve-llm/large-size-llm/README.html) - Multiple nodes, research\n",
    "\n",
    "**Anyscale Workspace Templates:**\n",
    "- [Anyscale LLM Deployment Templates](https://console.anyscale.com/template-preview/deployment-serve-llm) - Ready-to-run examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Other Sizes Differ\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've seen a medium model deployment, here's how other sizes would differ:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Small Models (7B-13B):**\n",
    "- No tensor parallelism needed\n",
    "- Single GPU deployment\n",
    "- Faster startup time\n",
    "- Lower concurrency but simpler setup\n",
    "\n",
    "**Large Models (400B+):**\n",
    "- Pipeline parallelism across multiple nodes\n",
    "- More complex infrastructure requirements\n",
    "- Higher costs but maximum capability\n",
    "- Research and specialized use cases\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Ready to explore more? Consider:\n",
    "1. **Try different model sizes** - Deploy small or large models\n",
    "2. **Experiment with optimizations** - Test quantization and concurrency tuning\n",
    "3. **Build applications** - Create end-to-end AI applications\n",
    "4. **Explore advanced features** - Multi-model deployments, custom endpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resources\n",
