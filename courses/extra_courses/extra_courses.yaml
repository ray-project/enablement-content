# Extra Courses Configuration
# This file defines "synthetic" courses composed of modules from existing courses.
# Each course has the same metadata structure as regular course.yaml files,
# plus a list of modules that should be included in the course.
#
# Module paths are relative to the courses/ directory and should point to
# existing module directories (e.g., "foundations/Ray_Data/00_Landscape")
