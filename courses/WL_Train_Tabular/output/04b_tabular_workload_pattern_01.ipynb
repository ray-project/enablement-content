    "### What you learn and take away\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ingest tabular data at scale using **Ray Data** and persist it to Parquet for reproducibility  \n",
    "- Launch a fault-tolerant, checkpoint enabled **XGBoost training loop** on multiple CPUs using **Ray Train**  \n",
    "- Resume training from checkpoints for protection agains job restarts and hardware failures  \n",
    "- Evaluate model accuracy, visualize feature importance, and scale batch inference using **Ray Data**  \n",
    "- Understand how to port classic gradient boosting workflows into a **fully distributed, multi-node training setup on Anyscale**"

    "### How to migrate this tabular workload to a distributed setup using Ray on Anyscale\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial walks through the end-to-end process of **migrating a local XGBoost training pipeline to a distributed Ray cluster running on Anyscale**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following steps make that transition:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Store local data as remote data**  \n",
    "   Store the raw data as Parquet in a shared cloud directory and load it using **Ray Data**, which streams and shards the dataset across workers automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Convert a single-process to multi-worker training**  \n",
    "   Define a custom `train_func`, then let **Ray Train** spin up 16 distributed training workers (1 per CPU) and run `xgb.train` in parallel, each with its own data shard.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Configure Ray for automated fault tolerance**  \n",
    "   With `RayTrainReportCallback` and `CheckpointConfig`, Ray saves checkpoints every 10 boosting rounds and can resume mid-training if any worker crashes or a job is re-launched.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Use Ray's cluster-scale abstractions**  \n",
    "   Skip the boilerplate of manually slicing datasets, coordinating workers, or building launch scripts. Instead, declare intent (with `ScalingConfig`, `RunConfig`, and `FailureConfig`) and let **Ray and Anyscale** manage the execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Use offline inference**  \n",
    "   Batch inference is done with **Ray Data** on CPU workers. This is useful for seamlessly evolving the pipeline to large-scale production environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern turns a traditional single-node workflow into a scalable, resilient training pipeline with minimal code changes, and it works seamlessly on any cluster you provision through Anyscale."
